Rather, it serves as a foundational tool, shedding light on various factors that influence consumer behavior and sales volume. As we navigate through this data, we acknowledge the inherent limitations and the possibility that additional data may be required for comprehensive decision-making.

we observed a counterintuitive trend where the utilization of promotions does not appear to correlate with increased sales; rather, it suggests an inverse relationship. 

To delve deeper into the unexpected relationship between promotions and sales, our analysis should focus on understanding the nature of the promotions employed and their effectiveness across different product categories within our dataset. By dissecting the specifics of each promotion type and evaluating their impact on sales performance, we aim to uncover insights into the underlying dynamics driving consumer behavior.

We can notice that our prices are higher than those of our competitors in each category.
